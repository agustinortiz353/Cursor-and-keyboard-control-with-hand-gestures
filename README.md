# Cursor-and-keyboard-control-with-hand-gestures
This project allows you to control your mouse cursor and keyboard input using hand gestures captured via a webcam. By leveraging MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for mouse and keyboard automation, you can interact with your computer without touching any physical devices.
