# Cursor-and-keyboard-control-with-hand-gestures
This project allows you to control your mouse cursor and keyboard input using hand gestures captured via a webcam. By leveraging MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for mouse and keyboard automation, you can interact with your computer without touching any physical devices.
Features

Cursor Control: Move the mouse cursor by moving the palm of your hand.

Left Click: Perform a left click by touching your thumb and index finger together.

Right Click: Perform a right click by touching your thumb and middle finger together.

Drawing Mode: Activate a "drawing mode" using voice commands to hold down the left click while moving the hand, enabling freehand drawing on the screen.

Voice Dictation: Use voice commands to type text directly into any application.

Visual Feedback: Real-time on-screen indicators show the current mode and dictation status.
